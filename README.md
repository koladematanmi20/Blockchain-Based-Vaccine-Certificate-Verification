# Blockchain-Based Vaccine Certificate Verification

A decentralized system for securely recording, issuing, and verifying vaccination status while maintaining privacy and data sovereignty.

## Overview

This blockchain solution addresses the challenges of vaccine certification by creating a secure, tamper-proof system for recording immunization history and enabling selective disclosure of vaccination status. The platform balances the need for verifiable health records with individual privacy rights, allowing authenticated verification without compromising sensitive personal data.

## Core Components

### Vaccination Record Contract

The Vaccination Record Contract securely stores essential immunization information:

- Records vaccine type, batch number, and administration date
- Stores administering healthcare provider information
- Creates tamper-proof immunization history
- Links to supporting medical documentation
- Maintains record of booster shots and additional doses
- Supports multiple vaccine types and immunization protocols

### Certificate Issuance Contract

The Certificate Issuance Contract generates verifiable proof of vaccination:

- Creates digital certificates cryptographically linked to identity
- Issues standardized vaccination credentials
- Implements expiration dates for time-sensitive certifications
- Supports revocation for invalidated certificates
- Generates QR codes for easy verification
- Complies with international health certificate standards

### Verification Contract

The Verification Contract enables authorized status confirmation:

- Allows trusted entities to verify vaccination status
- Implements role-based access for different verification needs
- Maintains audit logs of verification requests
- Validates certificate authenticity and expiration
- Supports offline verification capabilities
- Prevents counterfeiting through cryptographic proof

### Privacy Management Contract

The Privacy Management Contract ensures data protection and consent:

- Controls selective disclosure of vaccination information
- Implements granular consent mechanisms
- Enables time-limited access to vaccination records
- Supports data minimization principles
- Creates audit trails of data access
- Allows users to revoke previously granted access

## Benefits

- **Data Integrity**: Prevents falsification of vaccination records
- **Universal Verification**: Enables cross-border recognition of vaccination status
- **Individual Control**: Gives users sovereignty over their health data
- **Institutional Trust**: Reduces reliance on centralized record systems
- **Audit Capability**: Creates immutable logs of all system interactions
- **Interoperability**: Supports multiple health standards and verification requirements

## Implementation Requirements
